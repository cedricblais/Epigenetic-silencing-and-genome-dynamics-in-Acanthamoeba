### Bioinformatic analysis of viral DNA in Acanthamoeba str. C3 and Neff

This repository documents the bioinformatic tools used for the study "Epigenetic silencing and genome dynamics determine the fate of giant virus endogenizations in Acanthamoeba". Complementary files generated by, and used as input for, the code above can be found at [LINK].

## Viral sequence detection

Viral proteins were detected using a diamond BLASTp search of all predicted proteins and intergenic ORFs in Neff and C3 against a local copy of the NCBI database. `qsub diamond_blast.sh`

Taxonomy was assigned to hits using [acc2tax](https://github.com/richardmleggett/acc2tax). Hits to other Acanthamoeba proteins, as well as entries with taxonomy listed as 'NO TAXA FOUND', 'other entries' and 'Unknown' were filtered out using `grep -v ',Acanthamoeba,' $ | grep -v 'NO TAXA FOUND' | grep -v 'other entries' | grep -v 'Unknown'`. Proteins were retained as viral if either the top hit after filtering was viral, or if at least 5/10 top blast hits were viral.

Viral hallmark genes were detected using ViralRecall

`qsub viral_recall_hallmark_genes.sh`
